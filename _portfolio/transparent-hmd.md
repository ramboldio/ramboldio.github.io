Many people report that when there is one person in the room who uses a VR headset, it tends to become a disconnecting experience for the others. In my bachelor thesis, I worked on improving collaboration between in-VR users and bystanders by displaying the in-VR user's face on top of the HMD. Additionally, the system tracks the eyes of its observer to correct for the parallax error of the 2D display on the outside of the HMD.
