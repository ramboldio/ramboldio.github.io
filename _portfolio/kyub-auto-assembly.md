title: "Automatic Assembly of 2D SVG Plates to 3D Models"

Laser cut models are commonly shared as 2D vector information (usually SVGs). This makes it hard to alter the underlying implicit 3D model. In this work we are introducing a tool that allows users to reconstruct the 3D model from vector plate data and therefore, thus making parametric changes possible.
I was focusing on replacing the original joint geometry and generate new joints to match different kerfs, material thickness and geometry changes as well as visualizing the assembly tree search algorithm to enable parameter tuning.
