Behavioral Authentication is wildly used in websites and smartphones. But how does it translate to other domains of all-day life? In this work, we equipped a door handle with resistive and capacitive touch sensors and found out in a study that we can authenticate a person pressing the handle with 88% accuracy by classifying the sensor data.
I contributed the initial concept, created the Arduino-based hardware protoype, conducted the user study and implemented the classification code in Python.
