In this project we developed a remote that can adapt its button icons and the corresponding functionality depending on the current user. It accomplishes that with a eInk display under the buttons and a finger print reader for authentication. I contributed the concept, designed (Fusion 360) and fabricated the prototype and developed the Arduino code that runs on the remote.
