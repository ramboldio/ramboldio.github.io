We founded the startup Polyteia to help mayors and city councils to have their municipalities data in one place to analyze and compare. As the technical Co-Founder, I hired and manged the engineering team, lead the development of the custom data visualization components in D3js and custom data integration solution using Python, React & Electron and secured $800k in public R&D funding.
