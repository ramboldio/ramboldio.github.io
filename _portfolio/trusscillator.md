In this work, we are building a system that allows novice users to create stable structures that are subject to dynamic forces and acceleration.
I am responsible for the underlying simulation that is relying on differential equation solvers. For that, I looked deeply into continuous-time Modeling & Simulation systems like Modelica, current developments in differential equation solvers e.g. in Julia and non-linear optimization approaches.
