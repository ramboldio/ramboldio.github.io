# lukas rambold ✌️

Hi, I'm Lukas.
Currently, I'm a master student of IT System Engineering at [HPI](https://hpi.de/baudisch/home.html) in Berlin, focusing on HCI & Personal Fabrication.

Previously, I studied at [LMU](https://www.lmu.de) & [CDTM](https://cdtm.de) and co-founded the government data-analytics startup [Polyteia](https://polyteia.com).
